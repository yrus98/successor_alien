Intermediate design goals : 

- Create basic functionality for calculating the successor of alien number having base 5.

- Show leading zeros if input contains leading zeros and output length is less than raw input.

- Seperate functions to convert to base 5 and base 10 systems.

- Seperate functions to encode and decode alien strings.

- Optimize retrieving values correspoding to characters of B.

- Scale function to work with any base system instead of just base 5.

- Add new testcases.

- Increment the number directly without needing to convert to any intermediate base (base 10) system.

- Find any successor of n, not necessarily the immediate next one. The step size can be given as input.
